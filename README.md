# NASWOT-on-CIFAR-10

A) Reproduce the results of the paper “Neural Architecture Search without Training” on
CIFAR-10 Dataset and include all the results in your report as mentioned in the paper.
You can use the authors’ code (mostly provided via GitHub) or any other
reimplementation available on the internet. [cite the source].

B) Include your comprehension of the algorithm and codeflow in the report. 

C) Use any other dataset (excluding CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet,
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, STL-10) and elaborate your results on the chosen dataset.

D) There is always a scope for improvement and therefore improve the existing algorithm(
you may work on improving loss function, search techniques, etc). Provide mathematical
arguments why your improvement is working better than the existing one. Please include all
your findings in the report in a detailed manner.
